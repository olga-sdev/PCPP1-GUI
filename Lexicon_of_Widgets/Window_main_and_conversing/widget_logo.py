"""
Tkinter, the Python GUI library, allows you to use images in your interface quite easily with the PhotoImage.

A few notes:

Replace "path_to_image/logo.png" with the actual path to your image file.

The PhotoImage class only supports .png, .gif, and .ppm/.pgm formats.
If logo is in another format (e.g., .jpg) -> use the Pillow library (PIL) for loading it.

If logo isnâ€™t appearing, it might be due to the Python garbage collection removing the image.
To fix that, make sure keep a reference to the PhotoImage object.
