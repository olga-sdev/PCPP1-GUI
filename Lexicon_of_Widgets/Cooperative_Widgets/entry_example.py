"""
In tkinter, the Entry widget has a variety of properties and methods that you can use to customize its appearance and behavior.
Here's a quick rundown of some key properties and methods you might find useful:

Key Properties
* textvariable: Links the Entry widget to a StringVar, allowing you to update and retrieve its content dynamically.
* state: Controls the state of the widget. Common values:
* "normal": Editable.
* "disabled": Read-only.
* show: Masks the entry content (e.g., for passwords). You can assign a character like "*" or "â€¢".

Other Helpful Methods:
* get(): Retrieves the current content of the Entry.
* insert(index, text): Inserts text at a specific index.
* delete(start, end): Deletes content between start and end indices.
* config() or configure(): Updates the widget's properties dynamically.
