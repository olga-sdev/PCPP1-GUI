GUI ->  Graphical User Interface;

Mainframe -> powerful machines used primarily by large organizations for critical applications: can handle vast amounts of data and support thousands of users simultaneously.

Terminal -> monochrome interface through which a user can interact with a computer for tasks such as:
* Running scripts and programs.
* Managing files and directories.
* Configuring system settings.
* Debugging and troubleshooting.

Visual programming -> method of creating software using graphical elements and visual tools rather than writing text-based code.

Key aspects of visual programming include:
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) -> drag and drop elements, configure properties, and create workflows.
* Flowcharts and Diagrams -> represent the logic and structure of the program.
* Code Generation -> code based on the user's graphical input, often allowing for customization.

Widgets -> small, interactive applications or tools that provide specific functionality or information.

Components of Widgets"
* Title bar with Title and Closing Button;
* non-clickable icon – a small picture to identify that it's issue;
* label – text inside a window with explaination of issue or other purpose of widget;
* Yes | No clickable buttons.

Event-driven paradigm
event handler -> functions or methods in programming that are triggered in response to specific events or actions.
event controller -> responsible for managing and directing events between different parts of a system.

Common events:
pressing the mouse button;
releasing the mouse button (an ordinary mouse click consists of these two subsequent events)
moving the mouse cursor;
dragging something under the mouse cursor;
pressing and releasing a key;
tapping a screen;
tracking the passage of time;
monitoring a widget’s state change etc.

EVENT -> TRIGGER -> EVENT HANDLER -> EVENT LOOP

TkInter -> toolkit | adapter -> set of uniform facilities enables to write one code and not worry about portability for different OS.

adapter -> widget toolkit, a GUI toolkit, or a UX library.
